If you want to train with your own dataset, please generate label maps which are one-channel whose pixel values correspond to the object labels (i.e. 0,1,...,N-1, where N is the number of labels). This is because we need to generate one-hot vectors from the label maps. Please also specity --label_nc N during both training and testing.
If your input is not a label map, please just specify --label_nc 0 which will directly use the RGB colors as input. The folders should then be named train_A, train_B instead of train_label, train_img, where the goal is to translate images from A to B.
If you don't have instance maps or don't want to use them, please specify --no_instance.
The default setting for preprocessing is scale_width, which will scale the width of all training images to opt.loadSize (1024) while keeping the aspect ratio. If you want a different setting, please change it by using the --resize_or_crop option. For example, scale_width_and_crop first resizes the image to have width opt.loadSize and then does random cropping of size (opt.fineSize, opt.fineSize). crop skips the resizing step and only performs random cropping. If you don't want any preprocessing, please specify none, which will do nothing other than making sure the image is divisible by 32.
